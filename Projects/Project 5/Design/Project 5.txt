enemy types -

hunter - hunts in confined way path. can be killed with stage weapon.

stalker - intermittently stalks like scissorman. can't be killer.

murderer - hunts in mostly exhaustive path. can't be killed. only appears or goes away based on game event progression.

murderer (butt clencher variant) - like the other murderer, but this one starts slow but gains speed over straights.

when hiding, player fades to transparent and camera goes into first person view, meaning we don't have to have custom character hiding animations.

out of stalker view after time, goes back to originating spawn point, then disappears.

hunter tracks player by last seen while player not in sight.

hold down interact button for ten seconds to investigate (in a drawer, plays a sound like shuffling contents around during that time, or with a book, flipping pages).

when interacting, camera gets an additional mode where turning it doesn't  turn the character and it can only turn so far.

hostile furniture - after hiding in a piece of furniture or closet, once you step out, the door closes and can't be opened again.

you can kill hunters, but you have to find a one-use item to hit them with from behind first. item can't be used if hunter is aware of you (item icon has an X marked over it).

if enemy sees player in process of hiding, it will go to the thing the player is hiding in and interact with it, thus exposing player.

Progression Types -

A) Investigate POIs. Find a hidden key to leave.

B) Kill Hunter. Investigate its corpse to find key to leave.

Intro Stage - 1A, 2A. Find your keys before leaving the house ("Need to drive and don't want to lock myself out.") Upon finding your keys, you realize you also need to find your wallet, then suddenly a dry lightning flashes and the power goes out. Fortunately there's a small flash light on your keychain. Upon finding your wallet in the dark, leave the house / stage. "God I'm exhausted... I better get some coffee on the way."

Narrative Slides - Car crash on a long country road. Car is in a ditch, you don't remember the crash. You must've fallen asleep at the wheel. You search the car for your cell phone - can't find it. Might have been flung out the broken windshield. Look for the cell phone outside the car. Find cell phone - it's broken. The only thing you see is an abandoned, dilapidated plantation-style farm house. It's 4AM. You wait an hour for another car to pass by. None do. Approach the house.

Stage 1 - 2A - Enter dilapidated house. Darkness, no electricity.  You hear a sound, like a child's voice. "Hello? Is anyone here? Are you alone?" You hear nothing more. Find a door downstairs, locked. Find a key - enter.

Stage 2 - 6A - You hear a little girl's voice... "He wants to play with you...". You hear a loud bang. "Hello? Where are you? Are you okay?" You hear a gurgling growl. If the player tries to leave, notice door is locked behind them. No way to kill hunter; need to rummage through POIs in order to find key to next area.

Stage 3 - 5A - "We're going to eat you...!" The little girl's voice again. Stalker appears! Possible to hide for it to go away. When Stalker goes away, girl whispers "Coward..."

...

Stage Final - 8B

Main Plot Line -

The main character slowly discovers that she is a demon.

The bad ending has her become a demon form.

The good ending she becomes an angel, understanding that a mere three-dimensional view is not sufficient to see the difference between what is an angel and a demon.

MISC

having something small in the scene with just a bit of motion (like the small spinning table fan in RE7) can trick the player into thinking something dangerous is near - then realize it was just a harmless prop. that's effective for horror for two reasons - creates sudden tension and also make next encounter with danger more surprising.

a shallow time element i.e. doesn't really affect gameplay/progression but still part of the experience. time is determined by gameplay progress (including physical checkpoints) and can be associated with events like stalker appearance. also determines windowed room lighting making it at least slightly different each time room is entered. rendering complications can be minimised by keeping time still in such rooms.
