okay, so doing a little iteration with the interactive code reload, i've decided Project 5 is going to be a horror game like Clock Tower, but with stealth -

WASD moves character, Q peeks left and E peeks right (where peek = translate camera slightly to left or right of character)
left / right arrow turns
taking a cue from RE8
it takes two hits for the player to die
the first hit can't be recovered from except by health restore event or item
the second hit can be recovered from over time
stages consist of enemies that move along a predefined patrol path
these enemies are only vulnerable by attacking them from the back 
these are basic enemies
enemy type A
however, over a random amount of time (3-6 minutes)
another type of enemy shows up
enemy type B
Stalker Type
he acts as Scissorman in Clock Tower
when spawned, he always knows where you are by scent
(homegirl be smellin good, don't H8)

he is unkillable, basically
he only leaves the scene for two reasons -
1) you evade him for 3 minutes
2) you hide in a one-time hiding place or use a one-time use scene object to drive him away
that's it
that's the game
done, mic drop
ship it
