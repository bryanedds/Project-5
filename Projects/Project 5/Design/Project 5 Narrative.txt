Bearded, long-haired, Jeff Bridges-looking character: "I haven't gone insane. I've gone mad. There's a big difference," subtly nodding his head affirmatively.

Attractive female psychotherapist with moderate business skirt with crossed, dark panty hosed legs with high heels, "Maybe... you could explain to me the difference...?"

He tilts his head back slightly, briefly eyeing her critically, then pauses before responding - "At all times, an insane man is useless. At particular times... a madman is the only man of use."
